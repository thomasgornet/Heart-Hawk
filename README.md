## Overview

HeartHawk is a real-time heart health companion designed to provide comprehensive cardiovascular assessments using edge computing. Developed in just six hours at the Pulse Overdrive Hackathon, HeartHawk won first place in its track. The project was built by Neil Deo, Thomas Gornet, Minseob Shin, and Neil Rayu.

## Hackathon & Sponsors

HeartHawk was developed at Pulse Overdrive, a tech conference powered by Tesla, Marvell Technology, Astera Labs, and Texas Instruments. The event provided access to cutting-edge hardware and a platform to develop innovative solutions in embedded systems and health technology.

## Technology Stack

HeartHawk integrates a full end-to-end heart assessment pipeline:

- **Hardware**  
  - PPG (Photoplethysmography) sensor for heart rate monitoring  
  - Arduino for initial signal processing  
  - Raspberry Pi for edge computing  

- **Software & Algorithms**  
  - Real-time data acquisition and preprocessing  
  - Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis  
  - Calculation of SDNN, RMSSD, and other cardiac metrics  

## Key Features

- **Edge Computing** – Processes heart data locally on the Raspberry Pi for real-time insights  
- **HRV Analysis** – Extracts key health indicators such as SDNN and RMSSD  
- **Embedded Systems Integration** – Utilizes Arduino and Raspberry Pi for efficient signal processing  

## Results & Recognition

HeartHawk successfully demonstrated real-time heart diagnostics, securing first place in its track at the Hackathon. The project highlights the potential of embedded systems and machine learning in health monitoring applications.
